# Phase 07 — Consume Canned Responses (Composer Picker + AI)

**Priority:** P3 · **Status:** ✅ done · **Depends:** none

## Context

- [Audit report](../reports/from-domain-audit-to-planner-helpdesk-business-logic-report.md) gap #9 (managed but never consumed — confirmed)
- `supabase/migrations/20260716120300_sla_policies_and_canned_responses.sql:19-29` — `canned_responses` table
- `supabase/migrations/20260716120500_row_level_security.sql:181-188` — read gated on `canned.read`
- `src/features/tickets/api/suggest-reply.ts:12-16` — `SuggestReplyInput.cannedResponses?` param exists (stubbed)
- `src/features/tickets/components/ai-suggestion-panel.tsx:40-47` — caller never passes `cannedResponses`
- `src/features/tickets/components/ticket-composer.tsx` — no canned-response picker
- `src/features/admin/canned-responses/**` — existing admin CRUD (locate exact path)

## Overview

Canned responses have full admin CRUD but are **never consumed**: the composer has no picker, and
the only `ai-suggest-reply` caller never passes `cannedResponses` (`ai-suggestion-panel.tsx:40-47`)
even though the input type already supports it (`suggest-reply.ts:14`). Wire both ends — the
plumbing is already stubbed, so this is mostly frontend.

## Key insights from the audit

- The AI side is a one-line gap: `suggestReplyApi.draft` already accepts `cannedResponses?: string[]`
  (`suggest-reply.ts:12-16`); the caller just doesn't supply them. Fetch canned bodies and pass them.
- Reads are gated by `canned.read` (`row_level_security.sql:181`), which the `agent` role holds
  (`seed.sql:259` → permission `00000...009`). So agents can already fetch them; only the UI is
  missing.
- Two consumption points, one data source: a **composer picker** (insert a canned body into the
  Tiptap editor) and the **AI draft** (feed bodies as context). Reuse one `useCannedResponseList`
  query for both (DRY).

## Requirements

**Functional**

- **Composer picker:** in `ticket-composer.tsx`, a control (dropdown/command palette) listing canned
  responses by title; selecting one inserts its body into the editor (respecting the existing
  `draftToHtml` conversion / Tiptap content model). Visible only to holders of `canned.read`.
- **AI feed:** `ai-suggestion-panel.tsx` passes the canned-response bodies as `cannedResponses` to
  `useSuggestReply`, so drafts can reference the approved library.

**Non-functional**

- Query via TanStack Query key factory; reuse any existing `canned-responses` feature query rather
  than a new fetcher.
- i18n for the picker label/placeholder (`en` + `vi`).
- MSW: a `canned_responses` read handler if not already present, so the picker + tests work offline.

## Architecture / approach

```
composer ──► useCannedResponseList() ──► picker → editor.commands.setContent(draftToHtml(body))
ai panel ──► useCannedResponseList() ──► cannedResponses: bodies → useSuggestReply(...)
```

- Reuse/lift the canned-response list query so both `ticket-composer.tsx` and `ai-suggestion-panel.tsx`
  can call it. If the existing query lives under `features/admin/canned-responses/`, expose a
  ticket-facing read query in `features/tickets/api/` (or import the admin query if the boundary
  allows) — respect `no-restricted-imports`; prefer a small tickets-side read hook hitting the same
  table (closed feature taxonomy — `code-standards.md`).
- Composer: add a picker button in the existing toolbar row (`ticket-composer.tsx:118-143`); insert
  selected body via Tiptap (`setContent`/`insertContent`).
- AI panel: build `cannedResponses` from the list and pass into the `suggestReply.mutate` call
  (`ai-suggestion-panel.tsx:40-47`).

## Related code files

**Create**

- `src/features/tickets/api/canned-response-queries.ts` — ticket-facing read hook (`canned.read`)
- `src/features/tickets/components/canned-response-picker.tsx` — composer picker

**Modify**

- `src/features/tickets/components/ticket-composer.tsx` — mount the picker, insert into editor
- `src/features/tickets/components/ai-suggestion-panel.tsx` — pass `cannedResponses`
- `src/mocks/handlers/rest-handlers.ts` — `canned_responses` read handler (if missing)
- i18n YAML `scripts/data/{en,vi}.yaml` — picker labels
- Tests: picker inserts body; AI call includes cannedResponses

## Implementation steps

1. Add a ticket-facing `canned-response-queries.ts` read hook (select id/title/body, ordered).
2. Build `canned-response-picker.tsx` (command/dropdown over titles); on select, insert the body
   into the composer editor.
3. Mount the picker in `ticket-composer.tsx`, gated on `hasPermission('canned.read')`.
4. In `ai-suggestion-panel.tsx`, fetch the list and pass bodies as `cannedResponses` to
   `useSuggestReply`.
5. MSW: ensure a `canned_responses` read handler + fixtures exist for offline demo/tests.
6. i18n keys in `en` + `vi`; run `lang:check`.
7. Tests: selecting a canned response inserts its body; the AI mutate payload includes
   `cannedResponses`.

## Todo

- [x] `canned-response-queries.ts` — `useCannedResponses()` reads the whole library title-ordered, gated on `canned.read` (query key nested under the shared `canned_responses` root so admin edits invalidate it). Reuses the admin schema (tickets→admin imports already established: sla-card, filter-options).
- [x] `canned-response-picker.tsx` — DropdownMenu over titles; renders nothing until the library loads (so no dead control)
- [x] Composer mounts the picker (gated on `canned.read`) and inserts the body at the cursor via `insertContent` (not `setContent`), reusing `draftToHtml` for the plain-text bodies
- [x] AI panel passes `cannedResponses` (all bodies) to `useSuggestReply`
- [x] MSW: existing `canned_responses` read handler + `cannedResponseRows` fixtures already serve the unpaginated read — no change needed
- [x] i18n: `Tickets.CannedResponses` in `en` + `vi`; `lang:check` in sync (183 keys)
- [x] Tests: picker lists titles + inserts the chosen body + hides without `canned.read` (2); AI panel forwards the canned bodies to `ai-suggest-reply` (1). 148 total pass.

**Post-review (DONE, no blocking findings):** one Low test-flake fixed — the AI-panel test now awaits the canned-library load (via the query cache) before clicking "Draft reply", so the click can't beat the async fetch and send an empty context under CI load. Verified stable across repeated runs. Reviewer confirmed clean: XSS escape runs on the insert path, hook order safe, gating triple-consistent (`canned.read` on picker mount + query `enabled` + render-null-while-empty), query-key prefix invalidation from admin edits works, import boundary matches the existing tickets→admin pattern.

## Success criteria

An agent can pick a canned response from the composer and its body lands in the reply editor; the
AI "draft reply" now receives the canned-response library as context. Customers (no `canned.read`)
never see the picker. Works offline under MSW; covered by tests.

| HTML/format mismatch between stored body and Tiptap                | L×M | Reuse `draftToHtml` / treat body as plain text unless it's known-HTML              |
| Picker shown to customers                                          | L×L | Gate on `canned.read` (customers lack it)                                          |

## Security / RLS considerations

- Reads already gated by `canned.read` (`row_level_security.sql:181-183`); customers cannot fetch
  the library, so the picker naturally renders empty/hidden for them — still gate the UI to avoid a
  dead control.
- No writes here; the AI edge function already holds its key server-side (prior Phase 07 of the
  refactor plan) — passing canned bodies as context adds no secret exposure.

## Next steps

Final phase. After this, the seven help-desk gaps from the audit are closed.
